    <h1>Bikes for the people!</h1>

    </p>
    <p>It elucitated things I've been thinking about for a while, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Why do we have electric car subsidies, but not e-bike subsidies? Bikes
        are way cheaper and even more energy efficient. I guess most people
        don't have safe bike infrastructure, though.
      </li>
      <li>Biking is just joyful</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Great exercise</li>
        <li>It's a little aventure</li>
        <li>You see your neighbors</li>
        <li>
          Self reliance and agency - it's just you powering yourself around
        </li>
        <li>Kids can bike too!</li>
        <li>Never stuck in traffic</li>
        <li>Parking is a breeze</li>
        <li>You can smell the flowers</li>
        <li>You learn how to navigate your city</li>
        <li>You're never worried about accidentally mauling a pedestrian</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        When people bike they are making the city safer, quieter and cleaner
        versus if they were in a car. Why wouldn't we want to incentivize that?
      </li>
      <li>
        Here's to hoping more bikers leads to more bike lane advocates and more
        bike lanes leads to even more bikers...

        Let's build roads that our kids and grandparents feel safe using! After
        all, a full
