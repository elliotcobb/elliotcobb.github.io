      <h1>We're Story People</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">February 8, 2026 - Elliot C.</div>
      
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">People seem to be creatures defined by stories</a>. Stories about nations and souls and names, but also just the story of our lives. It brings me angst on Mondays when someone asks what I did that weekend and I don't have a tidy answer. Did I just waste my weekend? What kind of boring person can't think of something interesting to do all weekend? I don't have kids. I have money to spend. Surely there's no excuse for boredom. It's much better for my well-being to have a story about what my weekend was about. “I tried to learn about local birds, so I made stickers of all the birds I could see from our house”. Phew! I must not have wasted that weekend if there's such a pleasant narrative for it all.</p>

      <p>The workweek holds similar pitfalls. At my previous job, I was sitting at a desk all day writing code, but I was plagued by this gnawing feeling that I didn't know why I was doing it. I wasn't in love with my company. Why was I spending all day increasing search to book by 0.5 percent? It took a while, but I switched jobs.</p>
      
      <p>Now I spend all day sitting at a desk writing code that aims to increase road safety by 0.5% (or hopefully more). If you zoom out, my day is the same, but the story I tell myself about it makes the difference between misery and contentment.</p>
      
      <h3><a href="seinfeldNightGuy.html">The Kale brain and the Oreo brain</a></h3>
      
      <p>We contain multitudes. Only part of your brain cares about the story. I call this the Kale brain. It's rational and forward thinking. It knows that Kale is good for you and that eating it makes you better than other people. If you're fed and slept, Kale brain calmly mans the controls throughout the day. But around 10pm, Kale brain falls asleep and Oreo brain puts you on pleasure/survival auto pilot. You will stay up late bingeing Vanderpump Rules. You will finish the whole sleeve of Oreos. Oreo brain is always there running in the background, waiting to guide you towards food and bed. Oreo brain will not ask why or what it means for your story.</p>
      
      <h3>Bringing contentment by writing my story</h3>
      
      <p>My hope is that I can write a better story by recognizing when I'm giving the controls over to Oreo brain unnecessarily. And if I take time to write a story about what my weekend/week/year/life/relationships are about, I'll avoid the gnawing feeling of being empty and unmoored.</p>
      
      <p>So I'll make a special effort to do things that make for a story I want to tell.</p>
      
      <p>Here's an example. Weekend A, I watch the movie The Big Lebowski with friends and make popcorn with nutritional yeast and all have some laughs and a grand old time. Weekend B, I bet Nihar that he will laugh more than 10 times out loud at the Big Lebowski and the winner buys the other new socks, and then I make yeast popcorn and have a grand old time. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the second one is a story I'd love to tell and the first one is a more or less forgettable, but perfectly lovely evening.</p>
      
      <h3>Which part of the brain am I pleasing?</h3>
      
      <p>Weekend B seems like the sweet spot for me. Kale brain gets a nice story and can fantasize about winning/losing the bet for new socks. Oreo brain gets to enjoy one of mankind's greatest films and some puffed corn kernels. It's a one way ticket to pleasure town. And all the lobes are happy 🧠</p>
      

      <p>I'd stay and edit this, but I gotta run. Oreo brain is pulling the saucy bagel lever and Kale brain is losing steam fast.</p>
