            <h3>Not eating vegetables</h3>
            <p>
                Do you remember the glory of Pizza lunchables? I do. Remember
                being so young you didn't know how to bathe, but still making
                your own Pizza? Here you were, king of your own pie, belle of
                your own pizza ball.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you consider the ingretients, though, it doesn't seem so
                glorious. Once you peel back the plastic film, there are no
                hints of fresh basil or roasted tomatoes. It wasn't spicy
                because there were no spices. In fact it was sweet because the
                sauce was ketchup. It's room temperature, it's essentially a
                cracker crust, It's really more like you're eating a photo of a
                piece of pizza.
            </p>

                But hey you've got to know your customer, and let's face it kids
                have boring tastes. For some reason all the creativity and chaos
                they bring to their art and play gets left at the cafeteria
                door. They'll put anything in their mouths except if you tell
                them it's food. But I can't blame them. they're new to this
                world and I guess if you're 7, communion wafer Pizza is still
                quite exciting. Maybe the sad thing is that us adults can't find
                pleasure in the little things anymore. We have to eat
                okonomiyaki just to feel something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe lunchables are more so a reflection of how little time and
                creativity adults have that they're willing to send their kids
                to school with military rations.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing kids aren't picky about is PB&j. and the Lunchables of
                PB&j is another made-up adjective turned lunch product called
                Uncrustables, from the good people at Smuckers. The Smuckers
                Uncrustable is essentially a PBJ embryo wrapped in a thin film
                of melt in your mouth white bread. The hard thing about the
                uncrustable is that the peanut butter and the jelly were never
                completely mixed. It's like a yin yang symbol in there. and
                unless you held it up to the light like a film negative you're
                probably going to get an entire mouthful of dry peanut butter or
                a jelly shot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, I love uncrustables. And I bring them forth for your
                consideration because they're not any worse than a normal PB&j
                sandwich. Uncrustables are like if you go to Grandma's house
                expecting lasagna and she makes Stouffer's. It's not half bad.
                But a pizza lunchable is like showing up for pasta night and
                Grandma serves cup of noodles. It really leaves something to be
                desired.

            <h3>True story about Mimi.</h3>
            <p>
                My grandma Mimi is 96 years old, and we don't know how she got
                to be so old since, I swear to you, she does not eat vegetables.
                Tomatoes, no. Broccoli, no. Asparagus, no. Mushrooms, no. Onions
                and garlic, no. Maybe she knows something we don't. But I think
                her secret is that she's always thinking positive. Sometimes a
                little too positive. Like at Thanksgiving last year she was
                saying how no one in the family ever gets fat. Which is true,
                but apparently it's not because we eat vegetables. And then
                here's the part where she maybe takes the positive thinking a
                little too far. See if you can spot it.
            </p>
            <p>Grandma Mimi: "In the Cobb family no one really gets fat"</p>
            <p>Dad: "Well, there was uncle Karl."</p>
            <p>Grandma Mimi: "Well, he lost the weight..."</p>
            <p>Dad: "Mom, he had cancer."</p>
            <p>
                Did you catch that? Mimi took the late Uncle Karl's bout with
                cancer to be a somewhat positive occurance seeing as he did lose
                weight. Maybe a bit of a stretch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Love Mimi dearly, and I hope if I live to 96 I can also manage
                to do it solely on chicken alfredo. As my friend Micah says,
                that's a flex.

                I performed a more scattered version of this at Logan's birthday
                party at Radish. She wanted friends to do standup during dinner
                and a bunch of folks told great jokes!
