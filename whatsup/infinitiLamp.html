            These fine, clear, exceptionally large chunks were found scattered
            in front of 817 51st st last year. Collectors have been clamoring
            for them ever since. Not sure what it's from. Doesn't look like car
            glass.

            I find small blue chunks like this all over town, usually from side
            windows. I only take em home if they're in a nice, fresh pile. I
            feel bad for folks who get a window smashed, but I hope we can make
            something nice out of the situation with this lamp.

            Such a nice, clean pile. No sticks, no stems. It's like there's

            This Infiniti was brashly stolen in the dead of night and then
            ditched in Richmond, CA. Thankfully, Creedence tapes were recovered
            from the car. I manged to get out there in time and grab some glass.

            I was going to play volleyball at the beach but then I saw that a

            glass. It's laminated so to get it in chunks you have to use a heat
            gun and melt the laminate. I always travel with grocery bags since
            you never know when you might hit the jackpot and need to tote your
            treasure.

          <p>
            Window glass is often called tempered glass, or safety glass, since
            it breaks into chunks. These chunks are not sharp and refract light
            like a gem. The light refraction surprises our eyeballs which causes
            confusion, bewilderment, disbelief, awe, and eventually
            appreciation. We call this "eyball buzz" in the lighting business.

          <p>
            I don't know. My hope is that we can transform an act of
            destruction, rage, desperation into a work of art and clean a little
            broken glass from the street while we're at it.

            I bike everywhere and am always trying to avoid glass so I don't get
            flat tires. Glass is the most dangerous and prettiest trash on the
            road, and I love that juxtaposition. I think it's cool that on the
            road it's a shiny nuisance but in a jar it's glorious and even
            useful.

              >this lightbulb</a

            bulbs would be too hot for the glue inside the jar. It would be cool
            to experiment with candlelight-esque flicker LED bulbs and wifi
            controlled colorful bulbs, but haven't tried that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unscrew the jar from the base. Pull the cord and bulb out of the
            jar. Replace bulb.
