                    I try to avoid turning my life into a long string of
                    purchasing decisions, but there are some things that I
                    really am glad I have. You're never too old for toys, and
                    the older I get the more I'm interested in those things that
                    achieve the holy trinity of utility, beauty, and
                    sustainability. This gravel bike is nestled right in there.
                    It's a speed demon and I even put a trash can on it, which
                    is only a two-thirds trinity item if you're keeping score at
                    home.

                    Like many people, I'm constantly within arms reach of the
                    entire internet. I tell myself this is ok because I'm
                    self-respecting enough to only compulsively search for
                    <i>edifying</i> content. But if I'm really trying to get
                    edified and am not just addicted/bored of my own thoughts,
                    why don't I remember half the things I read, Hmm? So I
                    started taking notes to further justify to myself that I was
                    learning things.

                    This article produced some notes I keep coming back to, like
                    this paraphrase:
                </p>
                <p class="p-8">
                    <i
                        >Perhaps life is defined not by the options available to
                        us but by the strength of our commitments.</i

                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure you've felt emptiness in your life even at those
                    moments when you seem to have the utmost choices. Maybe you
                    spent all year waiting for summer break but when it came you
                    were somehow bored. Or you take your dream vacation, of what
                    to do with your time and life. I know I've been there. To
                    me, Brook's statement hit on a reason I love living in a
                    place where I'm relied upon and cherished for helping out
                    and hanging out around the house. When I'm gone, people miss
                    me, and I think they appreciate what I bring when I'm here.
                    Makes me feel like I belong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe I should do a whole book report on that article,
                    because I do think about it a lot. The "strength of your
                    commitments" life philosophy offers a way off the vexing
                    hedonic treadmill. For now, I'm smitten with the commitments
                    mentality.
