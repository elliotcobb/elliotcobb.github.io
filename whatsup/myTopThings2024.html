          I try to avoid turning my life into a long string of purchasing
          decisions, but there are some things that I really am glad I have.
          You're never too old for toys, and the older I get the more I'm
          interested in those things that achieve the holy trinity of utility,
          beauty, and sustainability. This gravel bike is nestled right in
          there. It's a speed demon and I even put a trash can on it, which is
          only a two-thirds trinity item if you're keeping score at home.

          coming back to, like this paraphrase:
        </p>
        <p class="p-8">
          <i
            >Perhaps life is defined not by the options available to us but by
            the strength of our commitments.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sure you've felt emptiness in your life even at those moments when
          you seem to have the utmost choices. Maybe you spent all year waiting
          for summer break but when it came you were somehow bored. I know I've
          been there. Brook's statement hit on a reason I love living in a place
          where I'm relied upon and cherished for helping out and hanging out
          around the house. When I'm gone, people miss me, and I think they
          appreciate what I bring when I'm here. Makes me feel like I belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I should do a whole book report on that article, because I think
          about it a lot. The "strength of your commitments" life philosophy
          offers a way off the vexing hedonic treadmill. For now, it's
          comforting trying to commit to things I care about and not worry if
          I'm not doing the coolest things with the coolest people.

          The Oscar for best Ken Burns film of the year goes to...
        </h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-500 mb-8">
          Ken Burns! for Leonardo Da Vinci
        </h3>
        <p>
          The American Buffalo was quite good, but I loved hearing about Da
          Vinci. I read the Walter Isaacson Da Vinci biography, but film is a
          better medium for diving into the splendor of Da Vinci's art and
          imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first blush, Da Vinci seems like he would be a pain to be around
          because he was always working. It seems like he never let himself
          rest. But his contemporaries say he was a delight - as funny and
          musical as he was scientific and exacting. What a nice balance!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was inspired by his passion for observation and sketching. He said
          to sketch something accurately you must truly see what is there. There
          are no lines in nature, Leonardo said, only overlapping shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we went to the aquarium this past weekend, I tried to sketch
          crabs and corals. It was fun! And got me in touch with the patient
          observation and reverance of the great master.
        </p>

        <img src="images/theLost.png" class="w-[350px]" />
        <p>
          I don't finish a lot of books, but I've been getting a little into
          etymology and geneology this year. I saw Daniel Mendelsohn as one of
          the talking heads in another Ken Burns film,
          <a
            class="underline text-blue-500"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_U.S._and_the_Holocaust"
            >The U.S. and the Holocaust</a
          >, and he basically goes on a decades long journey to find out what
          happened to his great uncle's family in the Holocaust. It's a race
          against time to talk to the 30 remaining Jews from Bolechow, Poland
          before they pass on.
        </p>
        <p>
          BTW, the message from the Ken Burns doc was basically that the reason
          so many Jews did not emigrate out of the path of the Nazis was that
          other countries refused to take them. Prescient considering today's
          immigration landscape.

          Dave Matthews Band Tour Bus Incident Re-enactment

          If you've ever been on the Chicago architecture boat tour you have
          stood in the shoes of unfortunate tourists who were unhygenically
          sprayed, soaked and

            2004.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To commemorate the occaision I decided we needed to re-enact. So we
          gathered a bunch of people in the back yard for a sort of trolley
          problem (to dump or not to dump?) decision for that tour bus driver.
          Then we had a concert where the Radish band played DMB covers. It was
          peak summertime yard enjoyment.

          One of my favorite things about Radish is that it's easy to host
          events for the housemates. There's a crew of 40 people who live here
          or used to, and if you get 10 of them together everyone else wants to
          be there too. It almost doesn't matter what the event is. And since we
          know each other well there's just all kinds of laughs and hijinks that
          we can get up to.

        <ul class="space-y-16">
          <li>
            <strong>Voice notes</strong><br /><br />Some people have stage
            fright with these, but I don't mind winging it and telling people
            what's on my mind. It's Like a phone call but you don't have to
            answer at a particular time. More nuance than a text. Easier than
            typing. I love em.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hang drying clothes</strong><br /><br />I just like the
            simple idea that if you're patient, the clothes dry themselves.
            Scratchy towels is my main complaint here. I found a
            HomesteadingToday.com thread on de-scratchifying, but it's mostly
            just a bunch of people being like "I love scratchy towels!" so F me
            I guess. Though, machine drying them for a few minutes does seem to
            work.

            <strong>Crocs</strong><br /><br />I resisted, but eventually
            aquiesced to the croc after finding a lightly used lavender pair
            abandoned in the house. Socks or no soccks, wet or dry. They're
            light, cushy, flexible, ugly. You really can have it all.<br /><br />Update:
            Jan.27th, 2024 - found out at dinner tonight that Radish Gina has
            been wondering where her lavender crocs have been for the last year
            and a half.

          <li>
            <strong>Nighttime phone lock</strong><br /><br />After having a
            phone/computer for 20 years, 2024 was the year I finally realized
            that I basically need parental controls for myself after 11pm. As
            Frieda and I like to say, that's when the Oreo Brain takes over.
            It's a nocturnal, reptillian persona that comes out juust before bed
            time to gorge itself on Doritos and Instagram reels. No matter how
            many times I promise myself not to have another late night internet
            bender, I always forget that agreements made in the light of day are
            pacts with the Quinoa Salad Brain, not old Oreo Brain.

            <br /><br />Thankfully some of our society's maturing attitudes
            about phone use have led Apple and Android to enable features that
            let us monitor and limit screen time. You can check how long you
            spend on your phone every day, how many times you unlock,

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >and more in the settings</a
            >. <br /><br />My friends Micah and Andrew set screen time limits
            and give the other person the password. They could ask for the
            password anytime but of course they can't stomach the embarassment
            of asking. This works pretty well for me too.<br /><br />

            <strong>Soap box:</strong> It bothers me that it's 2024 and we are
            only just starting to develop a cultural vocabulary around healthy
            phone use. Now AI's here. Will it take us 20 years to
            <i>start</i> to have an understanding of AI's effect on us, our
            kids, our institutions?<br /><br />

            <strong>Open source software</strong><br /><br />As a
            bay-area-minimalist-commune guy it's a little on the nose to be into
            open source software, but sometimes you just have to lean in. I
            guess simplicity, anti-consumption and collaboration drive a lot of
            my interests. <br /><br />Anyway, as it turns out, there's a global
            community of do-ers who actively maintain free versions of most
            tools and collections that people pay for on the internet. Wikipedia
            is the best example of this. It's written by everyday people and is
            way better than any traditional encyclopedia. All for free. Bonkers.
            I still do not know how it's as accurate as it is. I think it speaks
            to how well meaning most people are. The internet is supposed to be
            the domain of trolls and mean comments, but in this anonymous
            encyclopedia people are accurate and helpful. Maybe editing wikis is
            just so boring it doesn't attract many trolls.<br /><br />But
            there's open source Photoshop, Microsoft Office, video editing,
            messaging and more. Most are worse than the paid versions but quite
            servicable. The one i got into most in 2024 was Gimp, the open
            source photoshop, where I made some stickers and t shirts for my
            friends Ellen and Nihar's wedding.
