                A vegan/vegetarian who doesn't feel bad eating meat or fish
                that's going to waste. Sometimes meat grosses them out, and it's
                not worth eating, but other times it's like "what's the harm in
                eating this sandwich? Bad karma, maybe?" And then they chow
                down.
