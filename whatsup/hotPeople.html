                        In the age of flaking on plans I often wonder what's
                        getting people out of the house. I'm only slightly
                        ashamed to admit that I'm much more likely to attend an
                        event where everyone's super attractive. Sue me. And I
                        wonder how many people secretly or subconsciously feel
                        the same way...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I designed this experiment to test if people are just
                        scoping out the hotties when they choose where to
                        hangout.

                        class="rounded-md w-full h-full"
                    />
                </div>
                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <h2 class="text-xl">Experiment 1</h2>
                    <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-400">Who's hot?</h2>
                    <p>
                        First, I need to know who's hot and who's not. Hotness
                        is a fungible thing. In 1980's Dallas, it was big hair.
                        In Edo Japan it was wakushu boys with a shaved forelock.
                        Now it's anyone who's able to find employment and
                        suitable housing.

                        To get a baseline sample, I downloaded 20 stock profile
                        pictures and had people rank them from 1 to 10
                    </p>
                    <p>What we found will shock you.</p>

                        At the container store, we believe life's most important
                        boxes go beyond the casket. From the modern Aura line of
                        polyeurethene storage bins to the classic little house
                        on the prairie wood crate look, we believe anyone can
                        hoard discreetly in any style and for any season.

                            Ok we're back. And here's what we found
                        </summary>

                        <h3>Women are hotter than men</h3>
                        <p>
                            Maybe all that time not spent doing our hair and
                            brows caught up to us, or maybe as a society we're
                            just better at objectifying women. Or maybe stock
                            photo websites just choose photos of women based on
                            attractiveness moreso than men.
