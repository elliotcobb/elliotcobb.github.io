            In the age of flaking on plans I often wonder what's getting people
            out of the house. I'm only slightly ashamed to admit that I'm much
            more likely to attend an event where everyone's super attractive
            (sue me). And I wonder how many people secretly or subconsciously
            feel the same way...
          </p>
          <p>
            So I designed an experiment to test if people are just scoping out
            the hotties when they choose where to hangout.

            First, I needed to know who's hot and who's not. Hotness is a
            fungible thing. In 1980's Dallas, it was big hair. In Edo Japan it
            was

            and suitable housing.

          <p>
            To get a baseline sample, I downloaded 20 stock profile pictures and
            had people rank them from 1 to 10. We also asked if you were
            attracted to men and/or women and/or androgynous people.

                This is surprised me at first, but I don't think it should.
                We're pretty good at objectifying women, and there were more
                participants who said they were attracted to women (26) than men
                (19).

                But interestingly, even people who said they weren't into women
                rated the women's profile pics as more attractive, on average.

                  everyone else. Do you all have something you want to share? Or

                    feminine-looking photo got these non-men lovers all charged

              Then I asked people to rate how interested they were in the event
              on a scale of 0 (not excited) to 4 (excited)
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose these events since they spanned multiple hobbies. I wanted
              to see if hot people could pique people's interest regardless of
              the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              And there lies my whole thesis.

              I like board games, but I wouldn't play with just anyone. I want
              to play with clever, nice people who make me laugh. And if the
              whole time I'm putting the robber on their hex my lizard brain is
              pulling the fertile mate fire alarm, then all the better.

              Maybe this is all just telling of my phase of life, though. We
              should run a follow up experiment where we see if people who
              aren't actively dating care less about the smoke-shows and the
              nope-shows when choosing events.

              But... on average the people who saw the hotties were more likely
              to be excited about the event invite, followed by the control
              group, followed by the notties.

              The sample size is super small, but it appears that the notties
              had a wet blanket effect on event excitement (compared to the
              control). And that the hotties added slightly to the interest we
              saw in the control group.

              If I remember correctly from Mr. Dufford's 6th grade science
              class, you're supposed to stop the experiment once you find the
              results you're looking for. So i'm just going to call it here and
              move to publish. We did it! People are horny bastards who only
              want to come to your birthday because your eyes are the same
              distance from your nose.

                >the p-values for these effects are super high, meaning that,
                due to random noise, we'd be likely to see a difference like
                this even if Hot and Ugly have absolutely no effect on
                excitement.</span

            The other day I was walking by a storefront in San Francisco that
            had 10+ people bent over their work stations making things. They
            looked like stylish thirty-somethings who had just got off work and
            were getting their extra curriculars in. I didn't know what they
            were doing, but just based on there being 10+ people mingling in
            there having fun I was drawn to the place. The pottery was almost a
            non-factor in my interest. It was more about "are these the kind of
            people I could see spending time with?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe that's the type of calculus that gets people out mingling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gyms, bars, yoga studios, sports leagues, dance events. These are
            places where people go to see and be seen. Come for the sense of
            accomplishment at lifting weights/finishing 3 beers, stay for the
            cutites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe next I'll open two rival pottery studios - one for smoke-shows
            and one for nope-shows - and we'll see which one gets more inbound
            requests. All things being equal, wouldn't you want to carress some
            damp clay next to an adonis?
