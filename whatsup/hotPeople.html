                    <p>
                        In the age of flaking on plans I often wonder what's
                        getting people out of the house. I'm only slightly
                        ashamed to admit that I'm much more likely to attend an
                        event where everyone's super attractive. Sue me. And I
                        wonder how many people secretly or subconsciously feel
                        the same way...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I designed this experiment to test if people are just
                        scoping out the hotties when they choose where to
                        hangout.

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl">Experiment 1</h2>
                    <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-400">Who's hot?</h2>
                    <p>
                        First, I need to know who's hot and who's not. Hotness
                        is a fungible thing. In 1980's Dallas, it was big hair.
                        In Edo Japan it was wakushu boys with a shaved forelock.
                        Now it's anyone who's able to find employment and
                        suitable housing.

                    <p>
                        To get a baseline sample, I downloaded 20 stock profile
                        pictures and had people rank them from 1 to 10. We also
                        asked if you were attracted to men, women, and or
                        androgynous people.

                                it should. We've gotten pretty good over the
                                last 10k years at objectifying women, and there
                                were more participants who said they were
                                attracted to women (26) than men (19).

                                pics as more attractive, on average.

                                and replaced the profile pictures with our
                                hotties and notties.

                            Then I asked people to rate how interested they were
                            in the event on a scale of 0 (not excited) to 4
                            (excited)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I chose these events since they spanned multiple
                            hobbies. I wanted to see if hot people could pique
                            people's interest regardless of the event.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And there lies my whole thesis.

                            I like board games, but I wouldn't play them with
                            just anyone. If anything, if there were a crew of
                            people getting together just because they're into
                            board games, I might be <em>less likely</em> to
                            enjoy that event.

                            Or take the knitting club example. Imagine a bunch
                            of people getting together to knit. Are they
                            grannies? That's all fine and good, but imagine
                            they're all hot young people. Now that's a crew i'd
                            be interested in! Creative people weird enough to
                            take up knitting but still somehow conventionally
                            attractive? I'm intrigued. Maybe this is all just
                            telling of my phase of life, though. We should run a
                            follow up experiment where we see if people who
                            aren't actively dating care less about the
                            smoke-shows and the nope-shows.

                        The other day I was walking by a workshop in San
                        Francisco that had 10+ people bent over their work
                        stations making things. They looked like stylish
                        thirty-somethings who had just got off work and were
                        getting their extra curriculars in. I didn't even know
                        what they were doing, but just based on there being 10+
                        men and women in there having fun I was drawn to the
                        place. Also I like making things and DIY projects. By
                        the time I crossed the street to take a closer look, the
                        fact that they were making pottery was sort of a
                        non-factor in my interest. It was more about "are these
                        the kind of people I could see spending time with?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe next I'll open a pottery studio and have my
                        tuesday thursday cohort be total smokeshows and the
                        monday wednesday cohort be more noshows. Which pottery
                        studio would you be more intriguing as a passerby?
