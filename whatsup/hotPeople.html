                        In the age of flaking on plans I often wonder what's
                        getting people out of the house. I'm only slightly
                        ashamed to admit that I'm much more likely to attend an
                        event where everyone's super attractive. Sue me. And I
                        wonder how many people secretly or subconsciously feel
                        the same way...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I designed this experiment to test if people are just
                        scoping out the hotties when they choose where to
                        hangout.

                    <p>
                        First, I need to know who's hot and who's not. Hotness
                        is a fungible thing. In 1980's Dallas, it was big hair.
                        In Edo Japan it was wakushu boys with a shaved forelock.
                        Now it's anyone who's able to find employment and
                        suitable housing.

                    <p>
                        To get a baseline sample, I downloaded 20 stock profile
                        pictures and had people rank them from 1 to 10
                    </p>

                This is surprised me at first, but I don't think it should.
                We've gotten pretty good over the last 10k years at objectifying
                women, and there were more participants who said they were
                attracted to women (26) than men (19).
              </p>
              <p>
                But interestingly, even people who said they weren't into women
                rated the women's profile pics as more attractive.

              <p>And we can throw the androgynous fans in there as well.</p>

                They mostly split the difference between our more hetro-seeming
                participants... except they really went wild for photo number 16

              <p>Wowza!</p>

                Maybe all that time not spent doing our hair and brows caught up
                to us, or maybe as a society we're just better at objectifying
                women. Or maybe stock photo websites just choose photos of women
                based on attractiveness moreso than men.
